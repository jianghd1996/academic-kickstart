abstract: "Multi-modal data can provide more useful information for Human Action Recognition. But with the different formats, different modal data can only be used separately, which results a inefficient fusion. In this paper, we give comprehensive analysis of fusion schemes through experimental results and hope our work could benefit the community in multi-modal action recognition."
