abstract: "Designing a camera motion controller that has the capacity to move a virtual camera automatically in relation with contents of a 3D animation, in a cinematographic and principled way, is a complex and challenging task. Many cinematographic rules exist, yet practice shows there are significant stylistic variations in how these can be applied. 
In this paper, we propose an example-driven camera controller which can extract camera behaviors from an example film clip and re-apply the extracted behaviors to a 3D animation, through learning from a collection of camera motions."
